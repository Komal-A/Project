                <h1>My Learning Experience</h1>
                    <div class="Para">   
                        <p>Before starting BSc Computing program, I didn't know much about Web Development. So, I took this as an opportunity to learn something new that I hadn’t learned in my college. By limited research, I found information about HTML and CSS.  Little did I know that this was bare minimum needed for web development, and the actual process went much deeper than that. So here I would like to write about my learning process and the things I have learnt so far in these 10 weeks of term 1. The course was started to give a brief introduction about HTML, how to write a code in Editor and how the code structure looks like. It was just a start! Day by day I started learning different techniques which I can use to make my website attractive and presentable. I learned about how to create a CSS file, use different selectors to design the website using different properties, different properties of CSS including: Layout, Fonts, colours, box model etc.  How to make website mobile responsive including how to test the site for mobile, HTML specifications and its background. About Animation using transitions i.e., hover effects, fading menu and creating a sliding menu. I also had a brief session on GIT to understand the basics of GitHub. A brief session about version control, branches, and merging. How to make HTML form using Form elements, style them using CSS. As well as I had a lesson about advance CSS selector, explained well how to use selector to target the elements. At last, there was a lesson on keyframe animation in which I learned about advanced animations.</p>

                <h1>My Personal Development</h1>
                    <div class="Para">
                        <p>It was a big challenge for me to learn new language in this situation especially where the lectures are online. But my teacher Tom has been really helpful throughout the term. At the start of each lesson using “Kahoot” tool for revision helped me a lot to clarify the basic concepts as well as to identify my weaknesses. The recorded lectures which I could go through many times as I want to revise and clear my concepts. One thing I found difficult was, making the site mobile responsive which has given me some issues occasionally. I tried different tools to see how it works for example YouTube tutorials and a E-book https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/css-the/9781789954692/9781789954692-video1_1 which I found on NILE; helped me a lot to make my concepts clear but I never copy any code from Internet throughout in my website.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <!-- <div class="Grid">
                        <div class="column1"></div>                       -->
                         <h1>Site Development Report</h1>
                    <h3>Design:</h3> 
                        <p>I started work on website early November 2020. The design I was thinking in my mind I draw wireframe for each page to have an idea what actually I want and how it will look like. It was just a rough idea of my creativity which helped me a lot to achieve that in a real sense.</p>
                        <p>The Images of wireframe are below:</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <div class="images"><img src="images/wireframe-1.png" alt="wireframe(Home page)"></div>
                    <div class="images"><img src="images/wireframe-2.png" alt="wireframe(portfolio page)"></div>
                    <div class="images"><img src="images/wireframe-3.png" alt="wireframe(Cv page)"></div>
                    <div class="images"><img src="images/wireframe-4.png" alt="wireframe(contact page)"></div>
                    <div class="images"><img src="images/wireframe-5.png" alt="wireframe(wireframe sitereport)"></div>
                </div>
            <p></p>
                    </div>
        </main>
        <aside>
            <h1>About Site</h1>
                <p>The output I got for the "Home Page" was this in the beginning:</p>   
                <Img src="images/Home Page - Google Chrome 22_11_2020 11_46_53 (3).png" alt="homepage's screenshot">
                    <p>I managed to bring the text and image in the middle of the page using Grid. The code I used: "grid-template-areas:   "header header nav nav" 
                        ". main main ."
                        "footer footer footer footer"; to achieve desired output.</p>
                <img src="images/Home Page - Google Chrome 22_11_2020 11_55_10.png" alt="homepage's screenshot 2">

                <p>The output I got for the "contact page" was like this:</p>
                <img src="images/contact Page - 25_11_2020 10_04_08.png" alt="Contactpage's screenshot">
                <p>After using different css properties and go back to the lecture (Topic-8),I managed to get a well structured contact form. The final output is given below:</p>
                <img src="images/contact Page -  25_11_2020 10_09_36.png" alt="contactpages'screenshot">
            
                <p>For CV page I used grid to show my skills using columns(as required). The output was not that great so I included borders and changed font colors and background gave me satisfactory output. Screenshots of befor and after are below:
