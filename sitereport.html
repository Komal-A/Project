                    <p>
                        Before starting BSc Computing program, I didn't know much about Web Development. So, I took this as an opportunity to learn something new that I hadn’t learned in my college. By limited research, I found information about HTML and CSS.  Little did I know that this was bare minimum needed for web development, and the actual process went much deeper than that. So here I would like to write about my learning process and the things I have learnt so far in these 10 weeks of term 1. The course was started to give a brief introduction about HTML, how to write a code in Editor and how the code structure looks like. It was just a start! Day by day I started learning different techniques which I can use to make my website attractive and presentable. I learned about how to create a CSS file, use different selectors to design the website using different properties, different properties of CSS including: Layout, Fonts, colours, box model etc.  How to make website mobile responsive including how to test the site for mobile, HTML specifications and its background. About Animation using transitions i.e., hover effects, fading menu and creating a sliding menu. I also had a brief session on GIT to understand the basics of GitHub. A brief session about version control, branches, and merging. How to make HTML form using Form elements, style them using CSS. As well as I had a lesson about advance CSS selector, explained well how to use selector to target the elements. At last, there was a lesson on keyframe animation in which I learned about advanced animations.

                <div class= "my-paras text-allign">
                    <p>It was a big challenge for me to learn new language in this situation especially where the lectures are online. But my teacher Tom has been really helpful throughout the term. At the start of each lesson using “Kahoot” tool for revision helped me a lot to clarify the basic concepts as well as to identify my weaknesses. The recorded lectures which I could go through many times as I want to revise and clear my concepts. One thing I found difficult was, making the site mobile responsive which has given me some issues occasionally. I tried different tools to see how it works for example YouTube tutorials and a E-book <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/css-the/9781789954692/9781789954692-video1_1">CSS - The Complete Guide (incl. Flexbox, Grid and Sass) by Manuel LorenzMaximilian and Schwarzmüller </a> which I found on NILE; helped me a lot to make my concepts clear but I never copy any code from Internet throughout in my website.</p>

            <h3>DESIGN</h3>
            <p>I started work on website early November 2020. The design I was thinking in my mind I draw wireframe for each page to have an idea what actually I want and how it will look like. It was just a rough idea of my creativity which helped me a lot to achieve that in a real sense.</p>
            <p>The Images of wireframe are below:</p>
            <div class="wireframes">
                <img class="responsive" src="images/wireframe-1.png" alt="wireframe(Home page)">
                <img class="responsive" src="images/wireframe-2.png" alt="wireframe(portfolio page)">
                <img class="responsive" src="images/wireframe-3.png" alt="wireframe(Cv page)">
                <img class="responsive" src="images/wireframe-4.png" alt="wireframe(contact page)">
                <img class="responsive" src="images/wireframe-5.png" alt="wireframe(wireframe sitereport)">
            </div>
            <h4 class="page-labels">Discussion About Site:</h4>
            <p>During the whole assignment period, I learned much about CSS properties, how they plays role in making website attractive and mobile responsive and about different HTML tags where and how we can use them to get the desire output. How to assign classes and target them using css properties as well as the concept of id.</p> 
            <p>I chose the design of this portfolio on my own. I chose the color scheme with all the combinations of my choice. The font style I got from "Google" <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">font-family:'Source Serif Pro', serifGoogle fonts></a></p>
            <p>Every page has got the same layout and is able to reach on each page via navigation's tag. Each page has the heading with animation. I used grid layout throughout in my website to get well structured site. The site is mobile responsive as well. On mobile version there is a media query which allow the site to work on desktop as well as on mobile devices. All work on the website is my own except the burger Ion code which I copied from the lecture's slide.</p>

            <p>The output I got for the "Home Page" was this in the beginning:</p>
            <img class="responsive" src="images/Home Page - Google Chrome 22_11_2020 11_46_53 (3).png" alt="homepage's screenshot">
            <p>I managed to bring the text and image in the middle of the page using Grid. The code I used: "grid-template-areas:   "header header nav nav" 
                ". main main ."
                "footer footer footer footer"; and got output which is given below:

            <p>I made some changes over the time and afetr using animation, changing color of text and giving some padding, border and back-ground colour to the navs. I have got the final version of my "Home page" which you can see below:</p> 
            <img class="responsive" src="images/Home Page - Google Chrome 12_01_2021 23_21_07.png" alt="(Final)Home Page">
            <p>The portfolio page contains placeholder images and some text with headings and paragraph. The final output of the page is given below:</p>

            <p>The CV page is containing the content of CV. I used the grid for the layout. I applied different css properties for this page to make it attractive. The images of before and after are given below:</p>
            <p>1st attempt:</p>
            <img class="responsive" src="images/CV Page -  09_12_2020 17_20_32.png" alt="cv page">
            <p>2nd attempt:</p>
            <p>I used CSS properties and added some padding, border and changed back-ground color for headings to make it nice. But at that point I felt something is not enough so I gave it one more go to make it nicer so I added heading and add animation on it. The output of boths are given below: </p>
            <img class="responsive" src="images/Cv Page - Google Chrome 28_12_2020 15_42_42.png" alt="(2nd attempt)cv page">

            <img class="responsive" src="images/contact Page - 25_11_2020 10_04_08.png" alt="Contactpage's screenshot">
            <p>After using different css properties and go back to the lecture (Topic-8),I managed to get a well structured contact form for this page:</p>
            <img class="responsive" src="images/contact Page -  25_11_2020 10_09_36.png" alt="contactpages'screenshot">
            <P>For the final output, I changed the image and some style for the page to look attractive. The image of final output is given below:</P>
            <img class="responsive" src="images/contact Page - Google Chrome 12_01_2021 23_29_18.png" alt="(Final) contact page">
