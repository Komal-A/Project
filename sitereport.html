            <h2>My Learning Experience</h2>
                <p>Before starting BSc Computing program, I didn't know much about Web Development. So, I took this as an opportunity to learn something new that I hadn’t learned in my college. By limited research, I found information about HTML and CSS.  Little did I know that this was bare minimum needed for web development, and the actual process went much deeper than that. So here I would like to write about my learning process and the things I have learnt so far in these 10 weeks of term 1. The course was started to give a brief introduction about HTML, how to write a code in Editor and how the code structure looks like. It was just a start! Day by day I started learning different techniques which I can use to make my website attractive and presentable. I learned about how to create a CSS file, use different selectors to design the website using different properties, different properties of CSS including: Layout, Fonts, colours, box model etc.  How to make website mobile responsive including how to test the site for mobile, HTML specifications and its background. About Animation using transitions i.e., hover effects, fading menu and creating a sliding menu. I also had a brief session on GIT to understand the basics of GitHub. A brief session about version control, branches, and merging. How to make HTML form using Form elements, style them using CSS. As well as I had a lesson about advance CSS selector, explained well how to use selector to target the elements. At last, there was a lesson on keyframe animation in which I learned about advanced animations.</p>
            <h2>Personal Development</h2>
            <p>It was a big challenge for me to learn new language in this situation especially where the lectures are online. But my teacher Tom has been really helpful throughout the term. At the start of each lesson using “Kahoot” tool for revision helped me a lot to clarify the basic concepts as well as to identify my weaknesses. The recorded lectures which I could go through many times as I want to revise and uncleared concepts. One thing I found difficult was, making the site mobile responsive which has given me some issues occasionally. I tried different tools to see how it works for example YouTube tutorials and a E-book https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/css-the/9781789954692/9781789954692-video1_1 which I found on NILE; helped me a lot to make my concepts clear.</p>
